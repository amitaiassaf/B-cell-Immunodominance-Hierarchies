# B-cell-Immunodominance-Hierarchies



The yearly vaccine against the influenza virus targets a protein on its surface called hemagglutinin (HA), which helps the virus to bind and enter the host cells. Following vaccination, the immune system generates antibodies that target HA and can neutralize the virus. Most antibodies target the head of the HA protein, which mutates rapidly and often escapes those antibodies. The stem of HA contains conserved residues that are the target of broadly neutralizing antibodies. Eliciting strong antibody responses against the conserved part on the stem would offer universal protection. However, those conserved residues are immunologically recessive and are usually not targeted by the antibodies.

B cell immunodominance is phenomenon where some part of an antigen is targeted more strongly that other. We sought to understand what are the rules determining the immunodominance of the head versu the conserved part on the stem. We study the effect of three factors:

1] Immunogen geometry.

2] B cell precursor frequency against different HA epitopes.

3] The initial affinity of those B cell precursors torwards their target epitope.

To account for immunogen geometry, we created coarse grainded representation of four immunogen used for vaccination


We used molecular dynamics simulations to compute the on-rate of the second and first one rate of an antibody model to different surface residues (epitopes) of HA as they are presented on the immunogen

We computed the on rate of the first antibody arm and the second antibody.



Immunodominance is the immunological phenomenon in which immune responses are mounted against only a few of the antigenic

Operationally defining the rules governing epitope immunodominance hierarchies would be a critical asset in subverting this property. However, immunogenicity, or the strength of an antibody response against a given epitope, depends on a complex set of interactions during the humoral response and has consequently proven difficult to computationally delineate or predict 

Most flu vaccines consist of inactivated flu viruses. These viruses are coated with a protein called hemagglutinin (HA), which helps them bind to host cells. After vaccination, the immune system generates squadrons of antibodies that target the HA protein. These antibodies almost always bind to the head of the HA protein, which is the part of the protein that mutates the most rapidly. Parts of tThe HA stem, on the other hand, very rarely mutates. 

The influenza virus mutates

Each year, the flu vaccine has to be redesigned to account for mutations that the virus accumulates, and even then, the vaccine is often not fully protective for everyone.
